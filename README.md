# Gonzalo Berhouet

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a full-stack software developer. My fascination with programming started 5 years ago when I was doing eDx Data science on python courses. This led me to pursue a professional career as a Software Developer. I believed I needed a more serious approach towards this new world and as such, I decided to a career change.
At Makers Academy I worked on different languages as one of the bootcamp’s strength is that is language agnostic which equipped me with the ability to learn new coding languages depending on the project’s needs. Previously, I worked as a Senior Financial Analyst at Dyer Baade & Company M&A consulting firm in which I worked with financial datasets and models and also strengthened my attention to detail and presentation skills.
With the skills I have developed during the bootcamp and in my previous career, I believe I can contribute to the company with my ability to work under pressure and meeting tight deadlines. I enjoy working in a team environment and have great written and verbal communication skills. I believe in continuous learning and have been tirelessly investing on training and upskilling myself for future opportunities.</div>

## Skills

#### Curiosity

I started being fascinated about programming 5 years ago when I was doing eDx Data science on python courses.
These courses were really an eye opener to me as I discovered how vast and interesting the coding world is.

#### Team player

My experience have demostrated me that when working in a team increases the commitment of each team member with the team's objective. As a consequence, team's output will be higher quality and with fewer errors. I also have ability, when necessary, to stepback in order to evaluate the different alternatives that my team-mates are proposing.
